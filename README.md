# Kingsukh Guest House Website

Welcome to the Kingsukh Guest House website, a React-based project designed to showcase the hospitality and services offered by the Kingsukh Guest House, nestled in the serene hills of Barhanti, West Bengal.

## Description
This project is a single-page application (SPA) built using React, Bootstrap, and custom CSS. It provides an online presence for the guest house, featuring a modern interface, animated transitions, and responsive design to enhance user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### What is the Project?
The Kingsukh Guest House website is an online platform created to promote the guest house’s luxurious accommodations and services to potential guests, travel enthusiasts, and local visitors. The project aims to:
- Highlight the unique selling points, such as comfortable rooms, natural surroundings, and exceptional service.
- Provide an easy way for users to explore services (e.g., security, restaurant, tourist guides) and contact the guest house via a WhatsApp booking system or contact form.
- Serve as a digital portfolio for the guest house, appealing to a broad audience seeking a peaceful retreat in Barhanti.

The target audience includes tourists, families, and business travelers looking for a blend of comfort and nature, with a focus on user-friendly navigation and visually appealing content.

## Features
- **Home Page**: A welcoming hero section with a call-to-action, and an "Why Choose Us" section highlighting comfortable rooms, natural surroundings, and exceptional service.
- **Services Page**: Displays key offerings like high-class security, 24-hour room service, a restaurant, and tourist guide support with animated cards.
- **Rooms Page**: Showcases room options with images and details (placeholder for future expansion).
- **Gallery Page**: Features a gallery of images with hover effects (placeholder for future images).
- **Contact Page**: Includes a contact form and details (e.g., email, phone) with social media links.
- **Footer**: Provides navigation links, contact information, and social media icons with a professional design.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes with a mobile-friendly layout.
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in and slide-in effects using Animate.css for an engaging user experience.

## Redesign Process
The website was redesigned to improve its professionalism, usability, and visual appeal based on iterative feedback. Here’s how it was accomplished:
- **Initial Setup**: Started with a basic React structure using Create React App, integrating Bootstrap for responsive grids and Animate.css for animations.
- **Design Decisions**: Chose a color palette (#4A5D6A, #FF69B4, #2F4F4F) to reflect a calm yet inviting atmosphere, with custom CSS for unique styling (e.g., card hover effects, hero overlays).
- **Component Development**: Built modular components (Navbar, Hero, Services, etc.) with attention to user experience, ensuring smooth transitions and consistent typography.
- **Feedback Integration**: Iteratively refined layouts (e.g., centered footer sections, left-aligned to centered adjustments) and functionality (e.g., WhatsApp booking button) based on user input.
- **Optimization**: Ensured responsiveness with media queries and excluded `node_modules` from GitHub for efficient version control.
- **Tools Used**: React, Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons, Animate.css, and GitHub for collaboration and deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the dynamic user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive grid layout and components.
- **Bootstrap Icons**: For icons in services, rooms, and footer.
- **Animate.css**: For animations on page load.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a professional and consistent look.
- **GitHub**: For version control and deployment.
